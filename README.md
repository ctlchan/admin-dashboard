# admin-dashboard
## Introduction
An admin dashboard built using HTML and CSS. Based on a design provided by The Odin Project, but with an Elden Ring theme.

## After-thoughts
Since the project was put into the curriculum to put into practice the CSS Grid teaching material, I found myself trying to use Grid *everywhere*, even when it wasn't necessary. Things became much simpler when I took a stepback and looked at the design again, and identified areas where the more simple-nature of flexbox was more appropriate.
